Soils from northwest Alaska were homogenized and pre-incubated at -2 and -6 degrees Celsius for three months after which they were incubated at 2,4,6,8,10 degrees Celsius for one week. After the week long incubation soils were extracted using 0.5M K2SO4, and chloroform extracted to measure microbial biomass and nutrient concentrations. Sub-samples were also sent to PNNL for more comprehensive analysis of organic matter using FTICR, NMR, GC-MS and LC-MS techniques. Lipidomics were also performed to ascertain if there were any significant shifts lipids.
